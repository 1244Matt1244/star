#Enhanced Python Code with Turtle Graphics

### Documentation

#### Project Overview

This Python project uses the `turtle` module to create a graphical display with various shapes. The project includes functions to draw a square, a cube, and a star. Each shape is drawn with a specific color and size.

#### Key Functions

1. **draw_square(side_length)**:
   - This function draws a square with the given side length.
   - It uses a loop to draw four sides, each followed by a 90-degree turn.

2. **draw_cube(side_length)**:
   - This function draws a cube by filling a square with yellow color.
   - It calls the `draw_square` function to draw the cube's face.

3. **draw_star(size)**:
   - This function draws a star with the given size.
   - It uses a loop to draw five lines, each followed by a 144-degree turn.

4. **draw_scene()**:
   - This is the main function that sets up the scene by calling the individual shape drawing functions.
   - It positions the turtle at different locations to draw the square, cube, and star.

#### Usage

To run the project:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a Python file, e.g., `turtle_graphics.py`.
3. Run the file using a Python interpreter.

#### Enhancements

- **Speed Optimization**: The turtle's drawing speed is set to the fastest to reduce waiting time.
- **Structured Code**: The code is organized into functions for better readability and reusability.
- **Color and Fill**: Each shape is drawn with a specific color and filled appropriately.

This project can be further enhanced by adding more shapes, colors, and interactive elements.
